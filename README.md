# Interactive Periodic Table 

An engaging and educational web application that brings the Periodic Table of Elements to life. This interactive tool allows users to explore element properties, understand their classifications, and simulate simple chemical reactions in a visually intuitive way.

## 🌟 Features

### 🧬 Interactive Periodic Table
- **Complete Element Display:** All known elements arranged by atomic number and group.
- **Color-Coded Groups:** Elements are visually grouped by categories such as Alkali Metals, Noble Gases, Transition Metals, etc., with a clear legend.
- **Responsive Layout:** Table adapts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.

### 🔍 Element Details Panel
- **On-Click Info Display:** Clicking an element reveals detailed information including:
  - Atomic Number
  - Element Symbol and Name
  - Group and Period
  - Physical State at Room Temperature (solid, liquid, gas)
  - Common Uses and Applications
- **Dynamic Updates:** Details update instantly as different elements are selected.

### ⚗️ Reaction Simulator
- **Dual Element Selection:** Users can select two elements to simulate a chemical reaction.
- **Reaction Outcome:** Displays the resulting compound or indicates if no reaction occurs.
- **Visual Reaction Jars:** Three jars show the two reactants and the product with color-coded backgrounds representing element groups or compounds.
- **Clear Selection Button:** Resets the reaction jars and element details for new simulations.

### 💡 Help & Tips
- **"What reacts?" Button:** Provides quick guidance on how to use the reaction simulator effectively.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (Chrome,Edge)
- No installation required; runs entirely client-side

### Installation & Usage
1. **Download or Clone the Repository**
2. **Open `periodic table.html`** in your preferred web browser.
3. **Interact with the Table:**
   - Click elements to view details.
   - Select two elements to simulate reactions.
   - Use the "Clear Selection" button to reset.
   - Click "What reacts?" for usage tips.
